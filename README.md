A practical calculator with GUI featuring a calculating history, a hexadecimal converter & dark mode, as well as integration for many dialog tools.

### Basic Calculations

PraktiCalc helps you with basic calculations, something everyone needs and every calculator should provide.

### Keyboard Input
You can use your keyboard to type more quickly to get more efficiency when calculating.

### Native Design on Windows
PraktiCalc uses the native windows theme for the user interface to stay consistent with your other applications.

### Great themes on Linux
You have the choice between some UI themes on Linux using command line arguments. Huge thanks to the contributors of ttkthemes for creating these amazing designs. You can find the copyright information of each theme on the ttkthemes GitHub or the PyPi page.

### Dark Mode

If you use a system with a dark theme, you can make use of the dark mode in PraktiCalc, again made possible by ttkthemes.

### Broad Support
PraktiCalc supports Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and 11, as well as Debian and Debian-based distributions, Fedora, Alpine and TinyCore. Other distributions should be covered by the AppImage. 
If you use a newer Windows version, you can use compatibility mode in the file properties of the installer to install PraktiCalc. If you use Windows Vista, the installer for Windows 7 might work. You can also try to build PraktiCalc yourself. 
If you are on Windows XP, you can try to run PraktiCalc from the source code or build it yourself, that might be painful though. 
MacOS is currently not supported as I don’t have any MacOS hardware, but you can try to run PraktiCalc from the source code directly.

### High-DPI-Support
Tired of crunchy blurred apps that don’t scale well on modern high-resolution displays? PraktiCalc supports DPI-Scaling and looks crisp on every screen.

### Decimal Converter

Easily convert decimal numbers into binary or hexadecimal ones with the decimal converter in PraktiCalc.
You can also copy the output, if you need to.

### Great Dialog Messgebox Support
Don’t like the style of the messageboxes? Use PraktiCalc‘s integration for VBScript MsgBoxes, xmessage, yad, kdialog or zenity, or use the native tkinter style.

### A Calculating History

### Easy to install
Many hours were spent to make installations quick and easy. 
* On Windows, just download the PraktiCalc Installer for your version of Windows and open it.
* On Debian(-based) systems, download the PraktiCalc deb package for your architecture and install it by opening it with a software manager or by using ```sudo apt install prakticalc-xxx.deb```. 

### Developer tools
If you want to contribute to PraktiCalc and help with development, there are some developer tools for you. Use the Check button to print the values of the calculation variables, or use the more advanced PraktiCalc Console to get values of all global variables and manually execute functions within PraktiCalc. 
The Build scripts will help you to build PraktiCalc into installable packages.
